## What it does ⚙️
- A financial website to teach your kids about money management! Give them assignments (chores) to finish in exchange for money. Once they have accumulated enough coins, they can use them to purchase stocks as well as rewards!

- No actual money will be wasted in this market, so don't worry! We built a completely virtual stock market so that the kids could learn and practice investing wisely. It's usually a good idea to start them young, as some people assert.

- The tasks their children are given, the number of coins they earn for completing each activity, the incentives that are accessible, and the advancement of their children are all completely under parental control.

## Challenges we ran into 🏃‍♂️
- Adding AJAX was the most challenging part as it was our first time with Django.
- Also making the models was slightly tricky for us as we needed the user related details in each page frequently.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Rich, Clean and Responsive Design with every necessary functionalities. 
- We hadn't made this project by concern of college project, we really gave our best to implement necessary features and learn many new things.
